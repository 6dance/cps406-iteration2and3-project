Test Plan
Summary of Features
The user should be able to create a playlist from the current library of songs in blocks of 1 - 3 hours each.
A linked list will be implemented that will contain the desired songs for a playlist and will be used to save the playlist. It will then be read into a queue to be played. 
The song queue will have limitations that require the total time of all songs to be between 1 to 3 hours. Otherwise the queue will not be able to be playable.

A log of the songs played by users should be available to other users, with customization to time frame.
A list will be created for every user, with basic information of each song that they have played.
A time frame can be selected from a drop down menu containing time frames such as; 1 day, 1 week, all time etc.
A statistics page will be automatically created for each user account created.

The account should have the ability to save any of the user's playlists for future use.
Each user will be given a hash table upon creation of an account which will store all of the user’s playlists.  The keys for each table will be the user’s unique user name in conjunction with a unique playlist name per playlist.



Proposed Test Scenarios
New user created. Songs are able to be added to user’s songs played list, user statistics page displays “Most played” stats correctly
Inputs: New User with username = “Bob”, add Song with name =  “Hi”, length = 5, artist = “Billy”, genre = “Screamo”
Expected Outputs: On created dialog box ->
Bob Stats (Title)
Most Played Song: Hi
Favorite Artist:        Billy
Favorite Genre:      Screamo

Adding Song to Playlist: Song is added from Database to any playlist. Playlist is updated in GUI with the new Song.
Inputs: Song in Database playlist; New playlist
Expected Outputs:  New playlist now contains Song; GUI updated when playlist is refreshed

Accessing other users’ playlists: User cannot access another user’s playlist
Inputs: Create 2 Users; User1 adds playlist; switch to User2 and look at playlists
Output: User2 doesn’t have User1 playlist in playlists

Playlist Creation: User creates a new playlist with a name
Inputs: User1 adds a new playlist clicking Add Playlist button, Types in Playlist name = Testing
Outputs: Testing Playlist in playlists

Playlist over 3 hours or under 1 hour cannot be played: Playlist that is 3 hours cannot be played
Inputs: Playlist that is over 3 hours or under 1 hour
Outputs: Playlist not played

Risk Analysis
Could not test sorting songs by time frame due to time restraint and UI component not complete
Could not test admin functions due to UI component not complete
Playlist over 3 hours and under 1 hour cannot be played but it doesn’t return error
